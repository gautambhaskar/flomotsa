# FloMo TSA Website
A website about the TSA Chapter at Flower Mound High School designed by 3 team members and I. 

## Frameworks
Built with Materialize CSS and direct HTML. 

## Content
It is essentially a website about the FloMo TSA Chapter and Flower Mound HS. 

### NOTE: 
This Website was an overnight build by me to fulfill a newly found regulation the day before the competition. 
The regulation required this website to complement the INDIGOS TSA Website in the 'indigosfm' Repository
